# Session Summary - 2025-10-31

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Fixed critical Stroop gesture detection bug in TutorialView
  - TutorialView was using direct equality comparison (gesture == currentGesture)
  - This never matched Stroop gestures (.up != .stroop(...))
  - Added `isGestureCorrect()` validation function with Stroop-aware logic
  - Now finds which direction has text color and validates user swiped that way

- ✅ Fixed Stroop layout issues in StroopPromptView
  - Changed left/right labels from horizontal → vertical layout (per user request)
  - Reduced center word font: 100pt → 70pt (prevents truncation)
  - Reduced padding: 60 → 40 (top/bottom), 20 → 10 (left/right)
  - Added `.fixedSize()` to all labels to prevent wrapping
  - All color labels now visible without cutoff

## Testing Results
User confirmed:
- Gesture detection now works (swipe up registers correctly for BLUE→UP mapping)
- Layout improved with vertical left/right labels
- All labels visible on screen

## Implementation Details
**Files Modified:**
1. `TutorialView.swift` - Added Stroop gesture validation (lines 203-222)
2. `StroopPromptView.swift` - Redesigned layout with vertical labels and smaller fonts

## Next Session
- User will test full Stroop implementation across all game modes
- May need further layout tweaks based on testing
- Consider adding Stroop to tutorial instruction text improvements

## Key Decisions
- Vertical layout for left/right labels prevents horizontal overflow
- 70pt font size balances visibility with space constraints
- Used same validation pattern as GameModel/GameViewModel for consistency

## Blockers/Issues
- None - all reported issues resolved
