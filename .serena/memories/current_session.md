# Session Summary - 2025-10-27

## Session Overview
**Duration:** ~90 minutes
**Focus:** Unified failure feedback system implementation
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and tested

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Unified Failure Feedback System ‚úÖ
- **Created SoundManager.swift** - Audio feedback using iOS system sounds (SystemSoundID 1073)
- **Created FailureFeedbackManager.swift** - Coordinates sound + haptic simultaneously
- **Extended HapticManager.swift** - Added `playFailureFeedback()` with 2-pulse heavy buzz pattern

### 2. Integrated Across All Game Modes ‚úÖ
Updated failure points in 5 game modes:
- **Memory Mode** - GameViewModel.swift `gameOver()` method
- **Classic Mode** - GameViewModel.swift `classicModeGameOver()` method
- **Tutorial Mode** - TutorialView.swift `handleIncorrectGesture()` method
- **Player vs Player** - PlayerVsPlayerView.swift `handleWrongGesture()` + `handleTimeout()`
- **Game vs Player vs Player** - GameVsPlayerVsPlayerView.swift `recordPlayerFailure()`

### 3. UX Enhancement - Player Name Indicator ‚úÖ
- Added player name display to Game vs Player vs Player "Watch Sequence" screen
- Shows "[Player Name]'s Turn Up Next!" in yellow text
- Added `nextPlayerName` computed property
- Helps players know whose turn is coming before sequence ends

## Key Decisions

### Sound Selection
- **Initial:** SystemSoundID 1053 (Tock) - not audible during testing
- **Final:** SystemSoundID 1073 (SMS Alert 3) - more reliable, distinct failure tone
- **Rationale:** Built-in system sounds don't require audio files, work across devices

### Haptic Pattern
- **Pattern:** 2 heavy pulses with 100ms gap
- **Intensity:** 1.0 (maximum) for both pulses
- **Rationale:** Distinctly different from success feedback, clearly indicates failure

### Architecture Pattern
- **Singleton pattern** following existing HapticManager convention
- **Separation of concerns**: SoundManager (audio), HapticManager (haptic), FailureFeedbackManager (coordinator)
- **Single API**: `FailureFeedbackManager.shared.playFailureFeedback()` for all modes

## Testing Results

### User Feedback - Round 1
‚úÖ Haptic feedback verified and working
‚ùå No sound audible (SystemSoundID 1053 issue)
üîÑ Requested player name on sequence screen

### User Feedback - Round 2
‚úÖ Sound now audible (SystemSoundID 1073)
‚úÖ Player name indicator working correctly
‚úÖ All feedback working as expected

## Git Commit
- **Commit:** a6866c3
- **Message:** "feat: Add unified failure feedback system with sound and haptic"
- **Pushed:** ‚úÖ origin/main

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (User-Driven)
- Await user feedback on updated sound/haptic system
- Potential tweaks to sound ID if needed
- Other UX improvements based on testing

### Planned Features (from backlog)
- Sound effects and music (success sounds, background music)
- Achievement system
- Additional gestures (shake, pinch, rotate)
- Difficulty level selection
- Statistics dashboard

### Technical Improvements
- Cloud save and leaderboards
- Game Center integration
- Performance optimization if needed

## Blockers/Issues
None - all features implemented and tested successfully

## Notes
- Physical device testing required for haptic/sound verification
- SystemSoundID 1073 confirmed more reliable than 1053
- Player name indicator significantly improves Game vs PvP UX
- All existing functionality preserved, no breaking changes
