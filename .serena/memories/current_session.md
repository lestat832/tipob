# Session Summary - January 12, 2026

## Completed Tasks
- Verified App Store submission readiness (dev panel hidden, AdMob production IDs correct)
- Added 24 new quotes to Quote Bar (5→29 total)
- Troubleshot GA4 `(not set)` issue (confirmed code correct, GA4 backfill limitation)
- Created privacy policy page for getoutofpocket.com
- Updated privacy policy with accurate data practices (no server storage, third-party separation)

## App Store Status
- ✅ Dev panel hidden in production builds
- ✅ AdMob production IDs configured
- ✅ Privacy policy live at https://getoutofpocket.com/privacy
- ⚠️ Set AppConfig.appStoreID after creating App Store listing

## Next Session
- Create app in App Store Connect
- Set App Store ID in AppConfig.swift
- Final archive build test
- Submit to App Store!

## Key Decisions
- Privacy policy clarifies: we store nothing on servers, all local, third-party data is Google's responsibility
- GA4 custom dimension issue is timing-based, not code bug
