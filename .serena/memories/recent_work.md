# Recent Work Highlights

## Latest Achievement (Oct 27, 2025)
**Unified Failure Feedback System** - Complete audio + haptic feedback implementation

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Multi-sensory feedback** - Combined sound and haptic for clear failure indication
2. **Consistent UX** - Same feedback pattern across all 5 game modes
3. **Iterative improvement** - Quick response to user testing feedback (sound ID change)
4. **Enhanced clarity** - Player name indicator helps with turn management

### Technical Patterns Learned

#### System Sound Selection
- SystemSoundID values vary in reliability across devices
- SMS/Alert sounds (1073, 1006) more reliable than basic sounds (1053)
- Physical device testing essential for sound/haptic verification
- AVAudioSession configuration important for sound playback

#### Feedback Coordination
- Singleton managers for centralized feedback control
- Separate concerns: Sound, Haptic, Coordination
- Fire simultaneously for maximum impact
- Clean API: single method call for all feedback

#### UX Enhancement Patterns
- Visual + Audio + Haptic = comprehensive feedback
- Player context during transitions reduces confusion
- Yellow text for player indicators (matches winner announcement)
- Computed properties for clean player name access

### Code Quality Practices
- Zero warnings maintained
- Clean separation of concerns (3 manager classes)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive comments explaining "why"
- Physical device testing verified
