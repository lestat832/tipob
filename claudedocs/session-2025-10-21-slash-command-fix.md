# Session Summary: Slash Command Fix
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Focus:** Debugging and fixing `/hello` and `/bye` slash commands

## Issue Encountered

User reported that `/hello` and `/bye` slash commands were not appearing in Claude Code autocomplete and showing "No matching commands" error.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: Conflicting command locations causing autocomplete failure
- Global commands (`~/.claude/commands/`) had newer versions (Oct 21) that referenced Serena MCP tools directly
- Project-local commands (`.claude/commands/`) existed but weren't showing in autocomplete
- Claude Code prioritizes global commands but they were trying to use non-configured Serena MCP tools

## Investigation Steps

1. Checked project-local commands - existed with correct `/sc:load` and `/sc:save` integration
2. Discovered global commands were newer and conflicting
3. Initially deleted global commands (mistake)
4. Realized both needed to exist for autocomplete to work
5. Tested various configurations to understand Claude Code's slash command system

## Solution Implemented

**Final Configuration:**
- **Deleted project-local duplicates** to prevent conflicts
- **Created global commands** with Serena MCP integration via `/sc:load` and `/sc:save`
- **Single source of truth**: Global commands only (`~/.claude/commands/`)

**Files Modified:**
- Deleted: `.claude/commands/hello.md` (local)
- Deleted: `.claude/commands/bye.md` (local)
- Created: `~/.claude/commands/hello.md` (global, uses `/sc:load`)
- Created: `~/.claude/commands/bye.md` (global, uses `/sc:save`)

## Key Learning

**Claude Code Slash Command System:**
- Global commands (`~/.claude/commands/`) appear in autocomplete across all projects
- Project-local commands (`.claude/commands/`) may work but don't show in autocomplete UI
- For system-wide commands like `/hello` and `/bye`, global location is preferred
- Both command types properly call `/sc:load` and `/sc:save` for Serena MCP integration

## Verification

User successfully tested:
- `/hello` command appeared in autocomplete and executed properly
- `/bye` command appeared in autocomplete and executed properly
- Both commands maintain full Serena MCP integration through `/sc:*` commands

## Outcome

✅ **Success**: Slash commands working properly
✅ **Clean setup**: No duplicate commands, single source of truth
✅ **Preserved functionality**: Full Serena MCP integration maintained
✅ **Global availability**: Commands work across all projects

## Files Changed
- Deleted: `.claude/commands/hello.md`, `.claude/commands/bye.md`
- No code changes - configuration fix only

## Next Session
Continue with PvP mode testing or new feature implementation.
