4. **User testing reveals issues** simulators miss

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Testing
- [ ] Verify completion screen animations smooth
- [ ] Test "Keep Practicing" flow

- [ ] Implement Game vs P vs P gameplay
- [ ] Implement Player vs Player gameplay
- [ ] Add tutorial skip option for returning users
