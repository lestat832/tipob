| Gesture | Detection Method | Difficulty | Status |
|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| Swipe Up ‚Üë | DragGesture + angle calculation | Easy | ‚úÖ Live |
| Swipe Down ‚Üì | DragGesture + angle calculation | Easy | ‚úÖ Live |
| Swipe Left ‚Üê | DragGesture + angle calculation | Easy | ‚úÖ Live |
| Swipe Right ‚Üí | DragGesture + angle calculation | Easy | ‚úÖ Live |
| **Single Tap ‚äô** | TapGesture with disambiguation | Easy | ‚úÖ Implemented 2025-10-20 |
| **Double Tap ‚óé** | TapGesture with timing window | Easy | ‚úÖ Implemented 2025-10-20 |
| **Long Press ‚è∫** | LongPressGesture (600ms) | Easy | ‚úÖ Implemented 2025-10-20 |

**Total Gestures**: 7 (4 swipes + 3 touch gestures)

### Tier 1: High Priority - Easy Implementation üü¢

#### Touch-Based Gestures
| Gesture | Implementation | Complexity | Engagement | Accessibility | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Single Tap** | `.onTapGesture()` | Very Low | High | Excellent | P0 |
| **Double Tap** | `.onTapGesture(count: 2)` | Very Low | High | Good | P0 |
| **Long Press** | `.onLongPressGesture()` | Very Low | Medium | Excellent | P1 |
| **Two-Finger Swipe** | DragGesture with touch count | Low | Medium | Poor | P2 |

**Recommendation**: Implement all Tier 1 gestures in Phase 1
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours total
**Risk**: Very Low

**Implementation Notes**:
```swift
// Single Tap Example
.onTapGesture {
    viewModel.handleGesture(.tap)
}

// Double Tap Example
.onTapGesture(count: 2) {
    viewModel.handleGesture(.doubleTap)
}

// Long Press Example
.onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration: 0.5) {
    viewModel.handleGesture(.longPress)
}
```

---

### Tier 2: Medium Priority - Moderate Complexity üü°

#### Multi-Touch Gestures
| Gesture | Implementation | Complexity | Engagement | Accessibility | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Pinch** | `MagnificationGesture()` | Low | High | Poor | P1 |
| **Rotate** | `RotationGesture()` | Low | High | Poor | P1 |
| **Spread** | MagnificationGesture (inverse pinch) | Low | Medium | Poor | P2 |

**Implementation Notes**:
```swift
// Pinch/Spread Example
.gesture(
    MagnificationGesture()
        .onEnded { scale in
            if scale < 0.9 {
                viewModel.handleGesture(.pinch)
            } else if scale > 1.1 {
                viewModel.handleGesture(.spread)
            }
        }
)

// Rotate Example
.gesture(
    RotationGesture()
        .onEnded { angle in
            if abs(angle.degrees) > 30 {
                viewModel.handleGesture(.rotate)
            }
        }
)
```

#### Motion-Based Gestures
| Gesture | Implementation | Complexity | Engagement | Accessibility | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Shake** | CMMotionManager + acceleration threshold | Medium | Very High | Poor | P0 |
| **Tilt Left/Right** | CMMotionManager + device orientation | Medium | High | Poor | P1 |
| **Flip** | CMMotionManager + gravity vector | Medium | Medium | Very Poor | P3 |
| **Raise/Lower** | CMMotionManager + altitude change | High | Low | Very Poor | P4 |

**Recommendation**: Start with Shake only (most engaging, iconic Bop-It gesture)
**Estimated Effort**: 4-8 hours (includes CMMotionManager setup)
**Risk**: Medium (battery drain, device drop concerns)

**Implementation Notes**:
```swift
// Shake Detection
import CoreMotion

class MotionManager: ObservableObject {
    private let motionManager = CMMotionManager()
    private let shakeThreshold = 2.5

    func startMonitoring(onShake: @escaping () -> Void) {
        guard motionManager.isAccelerometerAvailable else { return }

        motionManager.accelerometerUpdateInterval = 0.1
        motionManager.startAccelerometerUpdates(to: .main) { data, error in
            guard let acceleration = data?.acceleration else { return }

            let magnitude = sqrt(
                pow(acceleration.x, 2) +
                pow(acceleration.y, 2) +
                pow(acceleration.z, 2)
            )

            if magnitude > self.shakeThreshold {
                onShake()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Privacy Consideration**: Motion data requires `NSMotionUsageDescription` in Info.plist

### Tier 3: Advanced - High Complexity üî¥

#### Pattern Recognition
| Gesture | Implementation | Complexity | Engagement | Accessibility | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Draw Circle** | Vision framework + shape recognition | High | Medium | Poor | P3 |
| **Draw Square** | Vision framework + shape recognition | High | Medium | Poor | P3 |
| **Draw Triangle** | Vision framework + shape recognition | High | Medium | Poor | P3 |
| **Custom Path** | Path tracking + ML model | Very High | Low | Very Poor | P5 |

**Recommendation**: Defer until post-launch, requires ML expertise
**Estimated Effort**: 40-80 hours (includes ML model training)
**Risk**: High (recognition accuracy issues)

#### Sensor-Based
| Gesture | Implementation | Complexity | Engagement | Accessibility | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Blow/Whistle** | AVAudioRecorder + frequency analysis | High | High | Poor | P2 |
| **Cover Camera** | AVCaptureSession + brightness detection | Medium | Medium | Poor | P4 |
| **Volume Buttons** | Hardware button monitoring | Low | Low | Good | P5 |
| **3D Touch** | `.onLongPressGesture` with pressure | Low | Medium | Poor | P3 |

**Risk**: Medium (microphone permission, false positives)

#### Accessibility Gestures
| Gesture | Implementation | Complexity | Engagement | Accessibility | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Voice Commands** | Speech recognition framework | Medium | High | Excellent | P1 |
| **Switch Control** | iOS accessibility API integration | High | Low | Excellent | P2 |

**Estimated Effort**: 6-12 hours
**Risk**: Low (Apple provides good APIs)

---

### Tier 4: Creative/Experimental üé®

| Gesture | Implementation | Complexity | Engagement | Notes |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Swipe from Edge** | UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer | Low | Medium | iOS native feel |
| **Triple Tap** | `.onTapGesture(count: 3)` | Very Low | Low | May be too fast |
| **Hold + Swipe Combo** | Simultaneous gesture detection | High | High | Advanced difficulty |
| **Pressure Touch** | Force touch (older devices only) | Low | Low | Limited device support |

**Recommendation**: Swipe from edge for premium feel, hold+swipe for advanced mode
**Priority**: P3 (post-launch enhancements)

---

### üö´ Gestures NOT Recommended

| Gesture | Reason | Alternative |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Spin** | Unreliable detection, user confusion | Use rotate instead |
| **Physical device flip** | High drop risk, safety concern | Use tilt instead |
| **Screenshot gesture** | System conflict, confusing UX | Skip entirely |
| **Raise/Lower device** | Poor accuracy, awkward posture | Use tilt instead |

```
Remove Ads:     $4.99 ‚Üê Anchor (most common)
Cosmetic Pack:  $1.99 ‚Üê Feels affordable by comparison
3-Pack Bundle:  $4.99 ‚Üê Same as Remove Ads, better value perception
Subscription:   $4.99/mo ‚Üê Matches Remove Ads, but recurring value
```

#### Regional Pricing
- US: Standard pricing

- **GDPR**: Consent for ads (IDFA), data deletion requests
- **CCPA**: California privacy rights, opt-out of data sales
- **App Tracking Transparency**: Request permission for IDFA (iOS 14.5+)

**Implementation**:
```swift
import AppTrackingTransparency

func requestTrackingPermission() {
    ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization { status in
        switch status {
        case .authorized:
            // Enable personalized ads
        case .denied:
            // Contextual ads only
        default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```
