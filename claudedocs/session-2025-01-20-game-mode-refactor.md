# Session Summary: Game Mode Refactoring
**Date:** January 20, 2025
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Objective
Refactor Tipob game modes to add a new Bop-It style reflex game and rename the existing memory-sequence game for clarity.

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Rename Classic to Memory Mode
- Renamed existing "Classic" mode to "Memory Mode" (üß†)
- Updated emoji from üéØ to üß†
- Changed description to sequence-focused: "Watch and repeat the growing sequence ‚Äî how long can you remember?"
- Added migration logic to convert saved "Classic" preferences to "Memory"
- Updated @AppStorage default from `.classic` to `.memory`

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Add NEW Classic Mode (Reflex Game)
- Created new "Classic Mode" (‚ö°) as Bop-It style reflex game
- Gameplay mechanics:
  - Show single random gesture with countdown timer
  - Starting time: 3.0 seconds
  - Speed increases by 0.2s every 3 successful gestures
  - Minimum reaction time: 1.0 seconds
  - Game ends on wrong gesture or timeout
  - Displays score on Game Over screen

### üìÅ Files Created
1. **[ClassicModeModel.swift](../Tipob/Models/ClassicModeModel.swift)**
   - Game logic for reflex mode
   - Score tracking
   - Speed progression system
   - Random gesture generation

2. **[ClassicModeView.swift](../Tipob/Views/ClassicModeView.swift)**
   - UI with large gesture display (120pt)
   - Countdown ring showing time remaining
   - Score display
   - Reaction time indicator
   - Gesture detection (swipes and taps)

### üìù Files Modified
1. **[GameMode.swift](../Tipob/Models/GameMode.swift)** - Added `.memory` case, updated `.classic` with new emoji and description
2. **[GameState.swift](../Tipob/Models/GameState.swift)** - Added `.classicMode` state for routing
3. **[GameViewModel.swift](../Tipob/ViewModels/GameViewModel.swift)** - Added Classic Mode methods, `isClassicMode` flag, timer management
4. **[ContentView.swift](../Tipob/Views/ContentView.swift)** - Added routing case for `.classicMode`
5. **[MenuView.swift](../Tipob/Views/MenuView.swift)** - Added mode-based routing logic with switch statement
6. **[GameOverView.swift](../Tipob/Views/GameOverView.swift)** - Conditional display: Score for Classic, Round for Memory

### üîß Bug Fixes
- Fixed compiler warning: Unused immutable value 'gesture' in `showNextClassicGesture()`
- Solution: Used discard pattern `_` for intentionally unused return value

## Technical Implementation Details

### Game Mode Enum Structure
```swift
enum GameMode: String, CaseIterable {
    case classic = "Classic"  // ‚ö° NEW reflex game
    case memory = "Memory"    // üß† RENAMED from old classic
    case tutorial = "Tutorial"
    // ... multiplayer modes
}
```

### State Management
- Added `isClassicMode` flag to `GameViewModel` for tracking active mode
- Set to `true` when `startClassicMode()` called
- Set to `false` when `startGame()` (Memory Mode) called
- Used in `GameOverView` to conditionally display Score vs Round

### Migration Strategy
```swift
private var selectedMode: GameMode {
    // Auto-migrate old "Classic" to "Memory"
    if selectedModeRawValue == "Classic" {
        selectedModeRawValue = "Memory"
    }
    return GameMode(rawValue: selectedModeRawValue) ?? .memory
}
```

### Speed Progression Algorithm
```swift
mutating func recordSuccess() {
    score += 1
    gesturesSinceSpeedUp += 1

    if gesturesSinceSpeedUp >= ClassicModeModel.speedUpInterval {
        gesturesSinceSpeedUp = 0
        let newTime = reactionTime - ClassicModeModel.speedUpAmount
        reactionTime = max(newTime, ClassicModeModel.minimumReactionTime)
    }
}
```

## Git Commits
1. `8879524` - feat: Add Classic Mode (reflex) and rename old Classic to Memory Mode
2. `8def9e6` - fix: Remove unused gesture variable in showNextClassicGesture

## Testing Checklist for User

### Memory Mode (üß†)
- [ ] Launch app and verify default mode is "Memory"
- [ ] Play game and confirm sequence gameplay works correctly
- [ ] Verify Game Over shows "Round" and "Best Streak"
- [ ] Test that old "Classic" saves migrate to "Memory"

### Classic Mode (‚ö°)
- [ ] Open game mode selector (üéÆ button)
- [ ] Select "Classic" mode
- [ ] Verify gesture displays correctly with countdown ring
- [ ] Test all 5 gestures: ‚Üë (up), ‚Üì (down), ‚Üê (left), ‚Üí (right), ‚äô (tap)
- [ ] Confirm speed increases every 3 successful gestures
- [ ] Verify countdown decreases by 0.2s each speed increase
- [ ] Confirm minimum time of 1.0s is enforced
- [ ] Verify Game Over shows "Score"
- [ ] Test wrong gesture ends game immediately
- [ ] Test timeout ends game with appropriate feedback

### Mode Selection & Persistence
- [ ] Verify selected mode persists between app launches
- [ ] Test switching between all modes
- [ ] Confirm mode selector shows all modes with correct emojis

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Mode Ordering:** Placed Classic first in enum to appear first in mode selector
2. **Migration Approach:** Auto-migration in computed property rather than one-time migration
3. **State Tracking:** Used `isClassicMode` boolean flag instead of inferring from gameState
4. **Game Over Display:** Conditional rendering based on mode rather than separate views
5. **Speed Progression:** Linear decrease with hard minimum to maintain playability

## Known Limitations
- Xcode build testing not available (command line tools only)
- User testing required to validate gameplay feel
- No persistence for Classic Mode high score (only Memory Mode best streak)

## Next Steps (If Needed)
- Add high score persistence for Classic Mode
- Add difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard with different starting times)
- Add visual feedback for speed increases
- Consider adding combo multipliers for consecutive successes
- Add sound effects for success/failure
