# Session Summary - 2025-10-24

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Removed SuperClaude framework from global configuration (~/.claude/)
  - Deleted FLAGS.md, PRINCIPLES.md, RULES.md
  - Deleted 8 MODE_*.md files
  - Deleted ~/.claude/commands/sc/ directory (25 commands)
  - Deleted unused MCP server docs (Context7, Magic, Morphllm, Playwright, Sequential, Tavily)
  - Deleted business/research framework files
- ✅ Achieved 56.7% token reduction (347KB → 150KB in .md files)
- ✅ Fixed tipob project commands to match working nova_scholartrail configuration
  - Removed broken symlink: .claude/commands/sc
  - Updated hello.md with direct Serena MCP integration
  - Updated bye.md with direct Serena MCP integration
  - Added bye-nopush.md command
- ✅ Verified configuration across all projects (nova_scholartrail, workout_app, tipob)
- ✅ Created backup: ~/.claude.backup-superclaude-20251024-114749/

## In Progress
- Waiting for VS Code window reload to activate Serena MCP connection
- Session persistence will use direct Serena tools once connected

## Next Session
1. **CRITICAL**: Reload VS Code window (Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window")
2. **VERIFY**: Check if Serena MCP tools are available (mcp__serena__*)
3. **TEST**: Run /hello and verify it loads from Serena memories
4. **TEST**: Run /bye and verify it saves to Serena memories
5. **RESUME**: Continue with tipob work (PvP testing or sound effects)

## Key Decisions
- **Migration Strategy**: Complete SuperClaude framework removal for maximum simplification
- **Direct Tool Usage**: No framework abstractions - use Serena MCP tools directly
- **Session Commands**: Streamlined to 3 essential commands (/hello, /bye, /bye-nopush)
- **Configuration Scope**: Global changes affect all projects, project-specific commands updated
- **Tipob Fix**: Brought tipob commands in line with working nova_scholartrail configuration

## Blockers/Issues
- **Serena MCP Not Connected**: VS Code extension requires full window reload for MCP servers to connect
- **Root Cause**: MCP servers configured but not loaded in current session
- **Solution**: Full VS Code reload (Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window")
- **Expected Result**: After reload, mcp__serena__* tools will be available

## Files Changed

### Global Configuration (~/.claude/)
**Deleted:**
- FLAGS.md, PRINCIPLES.md, RULES.md
- MODE_*.md (8 files)
- commands/sc/ (25 /sc:* commands)
- MCP_Context7.md, MCP_Magic.md, MCP_Morphllm.md, MCP_Playwright.md, MCP_Sequential.md, MCP_Tavily.md
- BUSINESS_PANEL_EXAMPLES.md, BUSINESS_SYMBOLS.md, RESEARCH_CONFIG.md

**Kept:**
- CLAUDE.md (2,655 bytes - streamlined)
- MCP_Serena.md (1,563 bytes - only MCP we use)
- commands/hello.md (direct Serena integration)
- commands/bye.md (direct Serena integration)
- commands/bye-nopush.md (direct Serena integration)

### Tipob Project (.claude/commands/)
**Deleted:**
- sc (broken symlink)

**Modified:**
- hello.md (now uses mcp__serena__list_memories, mcp__serena__read_memory)
- bye.md (now uses mcp__serena__write_memory)

**Added:**
- bye-nopush.md (local commit only, no push)

## Token Savings Achieved
- **Before**: 347,709 bytes of .md configuration files
- **After**: 150,386 bytes
- **Reduction**: 197,323 bytes (56.7% decrease!)
- **Expected Benefit**: ~2-2.5x more context space available for actual work

## What's Maintained
- ✅ All Serena MCP capabilities (once connected)
- ✅ Session persistence pattern
- ✅ Project memory management
- ✅ Essential development standards
- ✅ Git workflow best practices
- ✅ Session lifecycle commands

## Configuration Verification

### Working Projects ✅
- **nova_scholartrail**: Direct Serena MCP integration confirmed
- **workout_app**: Direct Serena MCP integration confirmed
- **tipob**: Now matches working configuration (after this session)

### Global ~/.claude/ ✅
- Only essential files remain (CLAUDE.md, MCP_Serena.md)
- 3 streamlined commands (/hello, /bye, /bye-nopush)
- No SuperClaude framework references
- No broken symlinks

## Testing Checklist (Next Session - After Reload)
- [ ] VS Code window reloaded (Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window")
- [ ] Serena MCP tools available (mcp__serena__*)
- [ ] /hello loads memories successfully
- [ ] /bye saves memories successfully
- [ ] Token usage significantly improved
- [ ] All functionality maintained
- [ ] Session persistence working across sessions
