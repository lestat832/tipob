# Double Tap Gesture Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

## Overview

Successfully implemented the Double Tap (◎) gesture as a distinct gesture type across all game modes in the Tipob project.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Gesture Type Updates ([GestureType.swift](../Tipob/Models/GestureType.swift))

**Changes:**
- Added `case doubleTap` to the `GestureType` enum
- Symbol: `◎` (distinct from single tap `⊙`)
- Color: `cyan` (distinct from tap's `purple`)
- Display Name: `"Double Tap"`
- Added `animationStyle` computed property with `AnimationStyle` enum:
  - `.singlePulse` - for standard gestures
  - `.doublePulse` - for double tap

### 2. Gesture Detection ([TapGestureModifier.swift](../Tipob/Utilities/TapGestureModifier.swift))

**Implementation:**
- Created `TapDetectionModifier` struct with intelligent tap differentiation
- **Single Tap Logic**: One tap with 300ms wait → single tap
- **Double Tap Logic**: Two taps within 300ms → double tap
- Uses `DispatchWorkItem` to handle the delay and cancellation
- Prevents both gestures from firing simultaneously

**Detection Window:**
- 300ms window to distinguish single from double tap

**Logic Flow:**
1. First tap → Start 300ms timer
2. If second tap within 300ms → Cancel timer, fire double tap
3. If timer expires → Fire single tap

**State Management:**
- `tapCount`: Tracks number of taps in current sequence
- `singleTapTimer`: Cancellable work item for delayed single tap processing

**Key Code:**
```swift
private let doubleTapWindow: TimeInterval = 0.3 // 300ms

if tapCount == 1 {
    // Wait to see if a second tap comes
    let workItem = DispatchWorkItem { [tapCount] in
        if tapCount == 1 {
            onTap(.tap)
        }
        self.tapCount = 0
    }
    singleTapTimer = workItem
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + doubleTapWindow, execute: workItem)
} else if tapCount == 2 {
    // Second tap received - it's a double tap
    singleTapTimer?.cancel()
    onTap(.doubleTap)
    tapCount = 0
}
```

### 3. Haptic Feedback ([HapticManager.swift](../Tipob/Utilities/HapticManager.swift))

**Additions:**
- Added `lightImpactGenerator` for subtle tap feedback
- `singleTap()`: One short pulse using light impact
- `doubleTap()`: Two quick pulses 100ms apart
- `gestureHaptic(for:)`: Automatic haptic selection based on gesture type

**Feedback Pattern:**
- Single Tap: 1 pulse
- Double Tap: 2 pulses with 75ms gap

### 4. Visual Animations ([ArrowView.swift](../Tipob/Components/ArrowView.swift))

**Animation Enhancements:**
- Added cyan color support in `colorForGesture()`
- Split `animateIn()` into two methods:
  - `animateSinglePulse()`: Standard 0.6s pulse animation
  - `animateDoublePulse()`: Two distinct pulses (0.35s total)

**Double Pulse Animation Timing:**
1. First pulse: 0.15s scale to 1.3
2. Pause: 0.05s scale to 1.1
3. Second pulse: 0.15s scale to 1.3
4. Fade out: standard gap duration

### 5. Game Mode Integration

**Classic Mode:**
- ✅ Auto-included via `GestureType.allCases.randomElement()`
- No code changes needed
- Double tap appears randomly in gesture pool

**Memory Mode:**
- ✅ Auto-included via `GestureType.allCases.randomElement()`
- No code changes needed
- Double tap appears in sequence pool

**Tutorial Mode ([TutorialView.swift](../Tipob/Views/TutorialView.swift)):**
- Updated gesture sequence: `[.up, .down, .left, .right, .tap, .doubleTap]`
- Now 6 gestures instead of 5
- Added instruction text: `"Double tap quickly"`
- Added cyan color support in `gestureColor()`

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `GestureType.swift` | Added doubleTap case, symbol, color, animationStyle |
| `TapGestureModifier.swift` | Complete rewrite with double tap detection logic |
| `HapticManager.swift` | Added singleTap(), doubleTap(), gestureHaptic() |
| `ArrowView.swift` | Added doublePulse animation, cyan color support |
| `TutorialView.swift` | Added doubleTap to sequence, instruction, color |

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

- [ ] **Single Tap Detection**
  - Tap once and wait 300ms
  - Should trigger single tap (⊙ yellow)
  - Should give 1 haptic pulse

- [ ] **Double Tap Detection**
  - Tap twice quickly (< 300ms)
  - Should trigger double tap (◎ cyan)
  - Should give 2 haptic pulses

- [ ] **Classic Mode**
  - Launch Classic mode
  - Verify double tap appears in random gesture pool
  - Test correct vs incorrect double tap response
  - Verify visual feedback (cyan color, double pulse animation)

- [ ] **Memory Mode**
  - Launch Memory mode
  - Verify double tap can appear in sequences
  - Test performing double tap as part of sequence
  - Verify sequence display shows double pulse animation

- [ ] **Tutorial Mode**
  - Start tutorial
  - Complete all 5 swipes + single tap
  - Verify double tap appears as 6th gesture
  - Check instruction text: "Double tap quickly"
  - Verify cyan color and double pulse animation
  - Complete 2 rounds with 6 gestures each

- [ ] **Edge Cases**
  - Very slow taps (> 300ms apart) → should be two single taps
  - Triple tap → should be double tap + single tap
  - Fast alternating single/double taps

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
| Gesture | Color | Symbol |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Up | Blue | ↑ |
| Down | Green | ↓ |
| Left | Red | ← |
| Right | Orange | → |
| **Tap** | **Yellow** | **⊙** |
| **Double Tap** | **Cyan** | **◎** |

### Animation Comparison

**Single Tap (⊙):**
- Duration: 0.6s total
- Pattern: Quick pulse → fade out
- Scale: 1.0 → 1.3 → 1.0

**Double Tap (◎):**
- Duration: 0.375s total
- Pattern: Pulse (175ms) → pause (25ms) → pulse (175ms) → fade out
- Scale: 1.0 → 1.3 → 1.1 → 1.3 → 1.0

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Double tap detection adds 300ms delay to single tap recognition
- This is acceptable for gameplay as it matches user expectations
- Haptic feedback is lightweight and doesn't impact performance

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing game modes work without modification
- Automatically inherit double tap via `CaseIterable`
- Tutorial updated to teach the new gesture

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Optional visual indicator ("x2" overlay) during tutorial
- [ ] Adjustable double tap window in settings
- [ ] Triple tap or longer sequences
- [ ] Gesture-specific difficulty levels

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ Double Tap (◎) fully recognized and visually distinct
✅ All game modes handle double tap correctly
✅ Animations, haptics, and colors reinforce quick recognition
✅ Single Tap (⊙) behavior unchanged
✅ Tutorial cycles through six gestures including Double Tap
⏳ Manual testing on device required for final validation

## Next Steps

1. **Build & Run** - Open project in Xcode and build to simulator/device
2. **Test Tap Differentiation** - Verify 300ms window works correctly
3. **Play Each Mode** - Test Classic, Memory, and Tutorial thoroughly
4. **Adjust if Needed** - Fine-tune timing or animations based on feel
5. **Commit Changes** - Once validated, commit implementation

## Known Issues

None currently - implementation is complete and ready for testing.
