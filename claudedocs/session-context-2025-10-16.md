- All changes committed and pushed ‚úÖ

## üîë Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Revert to Baseline
**Context**: 8-gesture implementation broke swipe detection
**Decision**: Revert to proven 4-swipe baseline
**Rationale**:
- Complex UnifiedGestureModifier had velocity calculation bugs
- Better to start with working code than fix complex broken code
- Incremental additions are more stable than big-bang changes

**Impact**: Positive - restored working game, clear path forward

### Decision 2: Incremental Gesture Addition Strategy
**Context**: Need to add 4 new gestures eventually
**Decision**: Add ONE gesture at a time, test thoroughly, then proceed
**Rationale**:
- Previous approach of adding 4 at once failed
- Testing each individually prevents cascading failures
- Easier to debug issues when changes are isolated

**Recommended Order**:
1. Single Tap (simplest)
2. Long Press (medium complexity)
3. Double Tap (tricky timing window)
4. Two-Finger Swipe (most complex)

### Decision 3: Distance-Only Swipe Detection
**Context**: Velocity calculation was unreliable
**Decision**: Use distance threshold only for swipe detection
**Rationale**:
- Velocity timing had timestamp staleness bug
- SwiftUI DragGesture already filters tiny movements
- Simpler is more reliable

**Impact**: Positive - swipes now work reliably

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Swipe Detection Broken
**Symptom**: All swipes stopped working after adding new gestures
**Root Cause**: UnifiedGestureModifier velocity calculation bug (stale timestamp)
**Fix**: Reverted to original SwipeGestureModifier
**Prevention**: Test gesture changes on device incrementally

### Issue 2: Crowded Launch Screen
**Symptom**: All gesture symbols displayed, cluttered UI
**Root Cause**: HStack iterating over all GestureType cases
**Fix**: Replaced with simple "Swipe to Survive" tagline
**File**: [LaunchView.swift:27-30](../Tipob/Views/LaunchView.swift#L27-30)

### Issue 3: First Gesture Invisible
**Symptom**: Players couldn't see initial gesture, always failed Round 1
**Root Cause**: No initial delay, gesture appeared/disappeared too fast
**Fix**: Added 0.5s delay before showing first gesture
**File**: [GameViewModel.swift:32-35](../Tipob/ViewModels/GameViewModel.swift#L32-35)

### Issue 4: Gesture Counter Bug
**Symptom**: Displayed "Gesture 4 of 3" after completing sequence
**Root Cause**: Index incremented before UI transition
**Fix**: Hide counter when `currentGestureIndex >= sequence.count`
**File**: [GamePlayView.swift:31-36](../Tipob/Views/GamePlayView.swift#L31-36)

## üìö Knowledge Gained

### Technical Insights
1. **SwiftUI Gesture Timing**: Animation durations must match display logic delays
2. **State Management**: UI updates happen before async transitions complete
3. **Device Testing**: Simulator doesn't accurately represent touch behavior
4. **Velocity Calculation**: Manual timing unreliable, use platform-provided values

### Development Patterns
1. **Incremental Changes**: One feature at a time reduces debugging complexity
2. **Baseline First**: Always verify working state before adding features
3. **Simple Wins**: Basic working code beats complex broken code
4. **Document Everything**: Future self will thank you

### User Experience Learnings
1. **First Impression**: Launch screen sets tone - keep it clean
2. **Visual Feedback**: Users need time to see and process gestures
3. **Clear Messaging**: Counter must always show valid, understandable numbers
4. **Timing Matters**: 0.5s can make difference between confusion and clarity

## üîÑ Next Session Plan

### Immediate Next Steps (Next Session)
1. **Add Single Tap Gesture**
   - Simplest addition to existing swipe system
   - Add to GestureType enum
   - Extend SwipeGestureModifier with TapGesture
   - Test thoroughly on iPhone
   - Commit if working

2. **Verify No Conflicts**
   - Ensure tap doesn't interfere with swipes
   - Check timing windows
   - Test multi-round gameplay

### Future Roadmap
1. Long Press (after tap works)
2. Double Tap (after long press works)
3. Two-Finger Swipe (after double tap works)
4. Memory Mode implementation
5. Tutorial screens for new gestures
